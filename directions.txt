 	-PROJECT: Analysis on Happiness from The World Happiness Report
	-Presented by Julian Hafza and Julien Counts

-SLIDE 2 (Basic overview of our analysis, JULIEN)
	- Introduce the World Happiness Report as a study of happiness trends across 165 countries
	from 2005 to 2022. 
	- Goal of The Happiness Report is to make happiness a worldwide goal of central policy 
	making.
	- Respondents in each nation are randomly surveyed and asked to rank their happiness level 
	based on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the worst life and 10 being the best life. These are 
	aggregated and averaged by country as the "life ladder".
	- Conducted via the use of surveys that ask individuals in each nation questions across 6
	dimensions:
	1. GDP per capita (log converted)
	2. Healthy life expectancy at birth (From the World Health Organization)
	3. Social support (0-1 scale, 0= no, 1=yes)
	4. Freedom to make life choices (0-1 scale, 0= no, 1=yes)
	5. Generosity (residual of regressing the national average of Gallop World Poll responses to 
	the Gallup World Poll question "Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?")
	6. Perceptions of corruption (0-1 scale, 0= no, 1=yes)
